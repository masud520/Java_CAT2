# *README.md* for BBT 1203 - CAT 2 Submission  

## *Repository Information*  
*Unit Code:* BBT 1203 - Object-Oriented Programming I  
*Assessment:* CAT 2 (Continuous Assessment Test)  
*Student Name:* [Your Name]  
*Registration Number:* [Your Reg No.]  
*GitHub Repository:* [Link to Your Repository]  

---

## *Solution Overview*  
This repository contains a *single Java file* (CAT2_Solutions.java) that implements all required concepts for CAT 2, including:  
1. *Encapsulation* (Student class)  
2. *Method Overloading & Overriding* (MathOperations, Animal, Dog, Cat)  
3. *Abstraction* (Appliance, Fan, TV)  
4. *Exception Handling* (Division with ArithmeticException)  

---

## *How to Run the Code*  

### *Prerequisites*  
- *Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+* installed  
- *Command Line/Terminal* access  

### *Steps*  
1. *Clone the Repository* (if applicable):  
   bash
   git clone [https://github.com/masud520/Java_CAT2]
   cd [Java_CAT2]
   

2. *Compile the Java File:*  
   bash
   javac CAT2_Solutions.java
   

3. *Run the Program:*  
   bash
   java CAT2_Solutions
   

4. *Expected Output:*  
   - Student details (with grade validation)  
   - Method overloading (multiplication of 2 and 3 numbers)  
   - Polymorphism (Animal, Dog, Cat sounds)  
   - Abstraction (Fan and TV turning on)  
   - Division program (handles division by zero)  

---

## *Code Structure*  
The CAT2_Solutions.java file contains:  

### *1. Encapsulation (Student Class)*  
- Private attributes (name, grade)  
- Public getters/setters  
- Grade validation (0-100)  

### *2. Method Overloading (MathOperations)*  
- multiply(int a, int b)  
- multiply(int a, int b, int c)  

### *3. Method Overriding & Polymorphism (Animal Hierarchy)*  
- Animal (base class)  
- Dog and Cat (subclasses overriding makeSound())  

### *4. Abstraction (Appliance Hierarchy)*  
- Abstract class Appliance with turnOn()  
- Concrete classes Fan and TV  

### *5. Exception Handling (Division Program)*  
- Takes user input for two numbers  
- Handles ArithmeticException (division by zero)

## *Notes for Submission*  
✅ *All code compiles and runs successfully*  
✅ *Follows OOP principles (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction)*  
✅ *Includes proper exception handling*  
✅ *Single-file solution for easy testing*
